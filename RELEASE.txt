                      Relase notes for SZIP 2.1
                          August, 2007


Bug fixes:

   -- On some platforms configure didn't add -lm flag; fixed

New features:

   -- Configure was updated to use GNU autotools version 1.5.14

Know problems:

   -- On IRIX64-6.5 shared library version 3.0 is created instead of 2.0
   -- On AIX 5.1 shared library is built but not installed. To bypass
      the problem modify libsz.la in the src/.libs directory: 
      replace line #11 
          library_names='libsz.a libsz.a' 
      with
          library_names='libsz.so.2' 

      before running "make install"
