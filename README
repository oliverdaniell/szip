To build SZIP Library

./configure --prefix=...
make
make test
make install

To build shared and static SZIP Libraries use -s flag with configure.
Default compiler is gcc. Use 

setenv CC "....." 
setenv CFLAGS "...."

to set desired compiler and flags. 

Known problems:

"make test" invokes SZIP test that seems to go into infinite loop. EIP, 3/12/03
